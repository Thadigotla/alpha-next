          The S- Drive is a wellness device, it is not designed to diagnose,
          detect or cure any illness. The S Drive is operated in 67 countries
          by: wellbeing practitioners, sports professionals, fitness and beauty
          centres, nutritional professionals, Dietary Advisors, Weight Loss
          Centres, Spa Resorts and preventative organisations.

          The S Drive is a portable device with a spectrum coil in its centre.
          We use the hair root bulb as an informational source, since the hair
          follicle is a part of the sensory system of the body. This In-Vivo
          biomarker expresses information from the environment that is present
          in the energy field.

        <div className="Alpha_details_para_3">
          The coil detects the hair & bulb resonance information, which is then
          digitized and sent securely to our remote computer centre in Germany,
          where the hair and bulbs digitized information is then decrypted. The
          information is then run through powerful logarithms in order to reveal
          relevancy and challenges, which the underlying systems of the body may
          have been experiencing over time. The resulting relevancy information
          provides a personalized, real-time overview of the underlying
          nutritional and metabolic conditions, which determine wellness and
          wellbeing.

          bulb follicles have proven to be effective biomarkers, as they
          accumulate information of Homeostasis and epigenetics over time.

          The ectoderm is the extreme outer layer of the neural tube, which
          forms at the end of the 4th week of gestation. This develops the hair

          the nails, the teeth along with the nervous system comprising the
          brain, the spinal cord and nerves. A developing foetus has all of its
          hair follicles created by the 22nd week of pregnancy. At this time,
          there are at least 5 million follicles over the body; one million of
          these are on the head, this will be the largest number of follicles we
          will ever have, as follicles cannot be added later in life. When we
          grow older, the size of the body increases and the density of hair
          follicles on the skin decreases.

          The S-Drive has an intended use that relates to supporting,
          maintaining or encouraging a general state of health. The S-Drive
          detects epigenetic signals that influence gene expression, so that
          changes to diet, nutrition and lifestyle can be adopted to support
          optimal physiology and performance. The S-Drive is neither invasive
          nor implanted, and does not involve a technology that may pose a risk
          to the safety of users or other persons if specific regulatory
          controls are not applied, such as, for example, risks from lasers or
          radiation exposure. Importantly, the S-Drive is not intended to
          diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease, as expressly stated on the
          reports that are generated from the S-Drive. The S-Drive is fully
