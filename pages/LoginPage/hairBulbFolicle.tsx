          Epigenetics is the science that shows that we do not need to be
          victims of our genetic inheritance. The Human Genome project, was
          expected to confirm the existence of over 100,000 individual genes.{" "}

        <div className="Alpha_details_block_2_para">
          {" "}
          However, it was discovered that only 23,000 genes make up the human
          genome, barely more than the common fruit fly and far less than those
          found in a grain of rice.{" "}

        <div className="Alpha_details_block_2_para">
          {" "}
          The answer is Epigenetics, which is the interaction between
          environmental signals and the process of adaptation that living
          systems use to thrive. Back in 1700’s Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed
          that life forms could acquire ‘information’ from their environment and
          incorporate it into their epigenome.{" "}

          Today, we know that gene expression that is not mediated by coding
          DNA, representing only 2% of the genomic expression. It is rather
          influenced by informational signals received from the environment by
          non-coding DNA, which represent the remaining 98% of what is referred
          to as junk DNA.{" "}

          Harmful information emanating from the environment such as Electro
          Magnetic stressors and toxic air pollutants, cause disharmony, so the
          human body responds accordingly changing the phenotype without
          altering the genotype. This change is reflected in our physiology.{" "}

        <div className="Alpha_details_block_2_para">
          {" "}
          These signals include information from the air we breathe, the food we
          eat, the water we drink, the sleep we did not get, the impact of the
          electromagnetic environment and even the arguments we are having and
          the 50,000+ thoughts we have per day.{" "}

          Hair belongs to the integumentary system that develops from the
          ectoderm and thus it has the same embryological origin as the nervous
          system. Therefore, it shares the same characteristics as the neurons
          when it comes to sensation.{" "}

          The root/bulb of the hair is the only part of the hair that is alive.
          Meaning it is able to self-regulate and self-replicate. It feeds from
          the blood vessels that bring information and nutrients from the
          systemic microcirculation which is subcutaneous through the papilla.{" "}
        </div>
        <div className="Alpha_details_block_2_para">
          {" "}
          The hair and its bulb are in fact an antenna that is constantly
          sensing and thus detecting environmental signals emanating from the
          micro and macro environment. So much so, that within the pilosebaceous
          unit there is a muscle called the arrector pili muscle, which are
          small muscles attached to hair follicles and are the smallest muscles
          in the body.{" "}
        </div>
        <div className="Alpha_details_block_2_para">
          {" "}
          This is the muscle that works as much as the cardiac muscle, since it
          is constantly sensing not just changes in temperature and atmospheric
          pressure, but vibration through resonance, and frequencies from the
          ecosystem and the surrounding area. The arrector pili muscle, along
          with the hair root bulb, were over-looked until recently as important
          environmental sensors - even though the hair has been accepted as an
          excellent bio marker.{" "}
        </div>
        <div className="Alpha_details_block_2_para">
          {" "}
          The arrector pili muscle reacts instantly to a systems shock and fear,
          causing the hair to ‘stand on end’. The arrector pili muscle also
          relaxes when the system is calm. In addition, its ‘sensing’ abilities
          have also been associated with the forewarning of impending danger.
          The arrector pili muscle also expands and contracts when the system is
          over heated or cooled. Therefore, the root bulb stores the epigenetic
          resonance information as it is connected to the arrector pili muscle.{" "}

          The S- Drive is a wellness device, it is not designed to diagnose,
          detect or cure any illness. The S Drive is operated in 67 countries
          by: wellbeing practitioners, sports professionals, fitness and beauty
          centres, nutritional professionals, Dietary Advisors, Weight Loss
          Centres, Spa Resorts and preventative organisations.{" "}

          The S Drive is a portable device with a spectrum coil in its centre.
          We use the hair root bulb as an informational source, since the hair
          follicle is a part of the sensory system of the body. This In-Vivo
          biomarker expresses information from the environment that is present
          in the energy field.{" "}

          The coil detects the hair & bulb resonance information, which is then
          digitized and sent securely to our remote computer centre in Germany,
          where the hair and bulbs digitized information is then decrypted. The
          information is then run through powerful logarithms in order to reveal
          relevancy and challenges, which the underlying systems of the body may
          have been experiencing over time. The resulting relevancy information
          provides a personalized, real-time overview of the underlying
          nutritional and metabolic conditions, which determine wellness and
          wellbeing.{" "}

          The technology relies on digitizing the information found in four
          strands of hair with their bulbs attached, plucked from the occipital
          area of the scull and within three minutes digitised. The hair and
          bulb follicles have proven to be effective biomarkers, as they
          accumulate information of Homeostasis and epigenetics over time.{" "}

          The gathered hair follicle information (excluding the clients name and
          address) is then encrypted by the S Drive program, before being
          securely sent through an internet connection, to an encrypted server
          at our informational centre located in Hamburg, Germany. Here the data
          is decoded, translated and scrutinized through an array of logarithms
          connected to an Ai processor, which then generates the completed
          commentary data pack. This personalized commentary data pack is
          returned securely through a separate server, linked to the
          practitioner’s coded S-Drive, within 15 minutes. The practitioner’s
          S-Drive program then automatically unpacks the data and creates the
          personalized PDF report. The S-Drive program then adds the client’s
          name and the practitioner’s details to the PDF report.{" "}

          The multi-page report can be viewed, printed or forwarded as an email
          attachment to the client. The wide-ranging observational reports
          provides the practitioner with additional underlying observations, to
          assist in decision making and determining supplementary protocols, in
          order to optimize the state of wellness and wellbeing of the client.
          The technology utilizes the principles of Homeostasis and epigenetics.
          The information is deduced by using four hair bulbs / follicles,
          plucked from the occipital (rear) area of the scull. The resulting
          personalized nutritional reports includes information on 12 Key
          Nutritional Indicators, plus additional pages on Gut, Immune and
          Circulatory support indicators, as well as Resistance and
          Environmental indicators. The 30 plus page report also highlights Food
          & Additive restrictions. All of the indicators are listed in an
          easy-to-read comprehensible report.{" "}
