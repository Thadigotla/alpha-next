          information is then run through powerful logarithms in order to reveal
          relevancy and challenges, which the underlying systems of the body may
          have been experiencing over time. The resulting relevancy information
          provides a personalized, real-time overview of the underlying

            systems use to thrive. Back in 1700’s Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed
            that life forms could acquire ‘information’ from their environment

          these are on the head, this will be the largest number of follicles we

            Hair belongs to the integumentary system that develops from the
            ectoderm and thus it has the same embryological origin as the
            nervous system. Therefore, it shares the same characteristics as the

            The root/bulb of the hair is the only part of the hair that is
            alive. Meaning it is able to self-regulate and self-replicate. It
            feeds from the blood vessels that bring information and nutrients
            from the systemic microcirculation which is subcutaneous through the
            papilla.

          <div className="Alpha_details_block_1_right_para_3">
            The hair and its bulb are in fact an antenna that is constantly
            sensing and thus detecting environmental signals emanating from the
            micro and macro environment. So much so, that within the
            pilosebaceous unit there is a muscle called the arrector pili
            muscle, which are small muscles attached to hair follicles and are
            the smallest muscles in the body.
          </div>
          <div className="Alpha_details_block_1_right_para_3">
            This is the muscle that works as much as the cardiac muscle, since
            it is constantly sensing not just changes in temperature and
            atmospheric pressure, but vibration through resonance, and
            frequencies from the ecosystem and the surrounding area. The
            arrector pili muscle, along with the hair root bulb, were
            over-looked until recently as important environmental sensors - even
            though the hair has been accepted as an excellent bio marker.
          </div>
          <div className="Alpha_details_block_1_right_para_3">
            The arrector pili muscle reacts instantly to a systems shock and
            fear, causing the hair to ‘stand on end’. The arrector pili muscle
            also relaxes when the system is calm. In addition, its ‘sensing’
            abilities have also been associated with the forewarning of
            impending danger. The arrector pili muscle also expands and
            contracts when the system is over heated or cooled. Therefore, the
            root bulb stores the epigenetic resonance information as it is
            connected to the arrector pili muscle.

            needs or actual deficiencies. The returned Environmental Statement
            could indicate that there is a high probability that some of the
            nutritional stores are empty, even when the blood or tissues show
            normal levels. As the signature waves are not a physical measure,
            but a carrier of information, they display a different picture of

            The nine assessed categories are ranked according to their overall
            status within the group. The aggregated scores present a picture of
            which categories are possibly having the highest impact and these
            are marked as ‘priorities’ and below these we have the secondary
            categories marked ‘advisory’. This provides some depth to the
            information which helps users to focus on supporting the cells in
            the most productive way.

            Within each category highlighted, we number the items according to
            their priority ranking, again making it easier to see where to start
            with nutritional protocols. The summary page captures all of this
            information in one easy-to-read table, listed in priority order with
            suggested actions.

            Included in the reports Information is a suggested 60-day Protocol
            which highlights specific foods to obtain optimal nutritional value
            and foods to avoid. The metabolic system requires time to adjust
            which is why we suggest a 60-Day protocol, before the next
            epigenetic assessment is conducted.
